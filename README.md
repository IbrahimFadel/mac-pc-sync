# mysync

A tool i'm building to help synchronize code between my pc and my school laptop.

This is built with rust even though i don't really know rust. It's probably really messy but i wouldn't know... i don't know rust.

Upload a file/directory to an amazon ec2 instance from a laptop or pc then compare the file versions and chose the most recent version of each file. These will be put in a 'common' folder on the ec2 instance which is where code will be pulled from into the local directories

TODO:
  - Compare files from school vs pc
  - Merge files into common
  - Pull from common
